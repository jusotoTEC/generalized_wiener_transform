## Description

* This repository contains the MATLAB code for numerical experiments presented in the paper "*A multi-filtering transform of random vectors: theoretical and computational aspects*". 
* This paper has been submitted for publication in a scientific journal. 
* This paper present a novel multi-filtering  transform for the purpose of data filtering, which operates on random vectors. The proposed transform aims to minimize the sum of distances between a reference random vector ${\bf x}_i$ and its transformed counterpart  ${\bf y}_i$, for all $i=1,...,p$. This transform generalizes the optimal linear filtering transform, which was originally designed for $p=1$. This paper provides a comprehensive theoretical development of the multi-filtering  transform, including the derivation of the optimal solution and thorough error analysis. Additionally, we present an efficient implementation for computing the matrix associated with the multi-filtering  transform. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed transform through numerical examples in signal and image processing and confirm its efficiency through computational experiments.
